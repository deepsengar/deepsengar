💼 Java Backend Developer (3+ Years)
🔗 Building scalable microservices for financial and enterprise systems

👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a backend engineer focused on building secure, scalable, and high-performance microservices in financial and enterprise environments.
Over the last 3+ years, I’ve worked across insurance and enterprise systems, improving API performance by 22%, reducing production incident resolution time by 50%, and contributing to high-availability distributed systems.
Recently completed the J.P. Morgan Chase Agile Software Engineering Virtual Experience, where I designed a Kafka-powered Spring Boot microservice for high-volume financial data processing.

I care about:

Clean architecture
Secure coding
System resiliency
Performance optimization
Production reliability
